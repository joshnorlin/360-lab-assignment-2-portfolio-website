## Pages

- `index.html` (Home)

- `portfolio.html`
- `contact.html` (form + Google Map)
- `signin.html`
- `signup.html`
- `terms.html`, `privacy.html`, `cookies.html`

Each page contains at least 2 paragraphs (50–100 words each across pages) and uses many HTML tags (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer, form, etc.). The current page’s menu link is highlighted.

## Local Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Navigate using the header links to verify each page.

## GitHub Pages (Publish Live Link)

1. Create a GitHub repository (public), e.g., `portfolio-website`.
2. Upload all files in this folder (including `index.html` and `style.css`).
3. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages.
4. Under “Build and deployment”, choose “Deploy from a branch”.
5. Select the `main` (or `master`) branch, folder `/root`, then Save.
6. After a minute, your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio-website/`.

## Deliverables Guidance

- Word document (.doc or .docx) that includes screenshots of all pages:
  - Home (`index.html`)
  - About
  - Portfolio
  - Contact (show the form and the map)
  - Sign in
  - Signup
  - Terms, Privacy, Cookies
  - Include the live website link on the last page of the doc
- A zip file of the source code (this entire folder).

Tip: For the map, you can replace the iframe `src` in `contact.html` with an embed from https://google-map-generator.com.
